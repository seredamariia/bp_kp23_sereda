Today, the largest war in Europe since World War II has been unfolding. Once again the world has to stand against evil, against terror, against genocide. Ukrainians are the ones on the battlefield today, but in a modern globalized world, everyone already is or will be affected by this war. And if the terrorist Russian state would not be stopped now, the whole human history may take a darker path for the decades to come.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has continued to harbor significant resentment against Independent Ukraine. Vladimir Putin, along with many Russians, shares a deeply flawed narrative about Ukrainians and Russians being "one nation", and Ukraine being an essential part of "Historical Russia". Part of the empire they are trying to restore.
